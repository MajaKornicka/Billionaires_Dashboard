### Project overview and questions for analysis
This project aims to analyze billionaires: who are they, in which industries are they successfull, what is the ratio of males to females, are they self-made, how old are they, etc.
I used PowerBI for data cleaning, analysis and creating the dashboard. I used calculated columns and measures to gain insights in the dataset.
